## GMT351- Geospatial Data Management Group-5 Final Project Report

The purpose of the project we created is to display the airport points correctly on the basemap on the created website, to prepare pop-ups that provide information about the selected airports, to filter the selected data according to countries, and to enable the user to create read update delete applications.


# Search Bar
In HTML projects, the "search" menu usually provides the user with an interface to perform a search operation. This menu is designed to help the user find a specific topic or content. The "Search" menu usually contains a text input box. This menu allows the user to quickly access the information they want. Users often navigate through the content of the site or application using this type of search function and can find the topic or page they want. In our project, the search bar was added to find the airports we want to reach, separated by country. Searches can be made using the countries included in the airport data. Another purpose of adding a search bar is to filter the data (on a country basis).
